What is Wyrm?
-------------
Wyrm is a 2D MOG (Multiplayer Online Game) based on SFML. It is aimed to be a
proof of concept for myself as well as my friends (who are avid gamers) rather
than (some day) a finished product. As such don't be annoyed if no progress is
made for a very long time. I only work on it when I feel like making a quality
contribution to it.

Because I among others am annoyed at "modern" games trading quality,
long-lasting, enjoyable gameplay for "quality" aesthetic features e.g graphics,
sound, etc. which I really don't care about, I have set myself the task of
designing and implementing a fun game which is supposed to be largely about
good gameplay and less about high-end eye-candy. It's sole purpose is to prove
my assumption that modern game developers have the resources to design fun
games but are pressured to produce "fodder" for the masses who don't care as
much as I do about gameplay as opposed to exploiting the newest hardware the
best they can.

Because I am a programmer myself I can take the advice "If you want something
done right, do it yourself." literally. I don't plan on forcing myself to
complete this project someday, maybe it will never be complete, it serves more
as an "Idle Process" as it is called in Window$. However if there are any
other developers/gamers out there who share the same goals as I do feel free to
contact me via e-mail or use the available features here on GitHub to fork your
own branch and contribute back once you are ready, we'll be able to work
something out ;). Any help is of course greatly appreciated.
